[UNFINISHED, UNMAINTAINED] Backend for a DnD-flavoured event planning web app written in Rust, using Rocket for API construction, Diesel as an ORM, Postgres as the database, and using JWT Tokens for login

This backend for a hobby mini-project of a DnD-flavoured event planning web app was a first attempt at using Rust as part of a web app. In conjunction with the [frontend](https://github.com/SRugina/dnd_agenda_frontend), it implemented JWT Tokens for login, as well as being a first attempt at using the Rocket package to designing APIs and the Diesel package as an ORM to handle relational database structure. Using realworld.io as an initial guide, the codebase demonstrates an understanding of key aspects for backend projects such as database schemas and a RESTful API design, though it lacked proper commenting & documentation of code, as well as a lack of tests due to its hobbyist/first-attempt nature that was more focused on learning the core ideas involved with implementing a backend on a knowledge-level than creating a concrete open-source codebase with strong style and best practices etc.
